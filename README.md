# 📖 Enumerable <a name="about-project"></a>
In this project I have created the following classes:
- #Person
- #Student
- #Teacher

What each class does:
- #Person -  represents an individual with an ID, name, and age. The class allows for setting and getting the name and age attributes of the person. It also has a private method of_age? which returns true if the person is 18 years or older, and a public method can_use_services? which returns true if the person is of age or has permission from their parent. 
- #Student - is a subclass of the Person class and has an additional instance variable @classroom. It also has a method play_hooky which returns a string of "¯\(ツ)/¯". This class represents a student and has the ability to skip class.
- #Teacher -  represents a person who has a specialization in a particular subject and is always able to use services regardless of their age or parental permission.
